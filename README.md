# Windows Phone File Sender

Send multiple files to your windows-phone device in Linux OS. You can even use WPFS in order to automatically send file to any device that supports MTP (Media Transfer Protocol).

## Usage:

You can specify the file type by `-t` flag (*`music`*, *`picture`*, *`video`*) and use `-d` flag in order to speficy the destination.

**Here is an example:**

```
 python3.4 windowsphone-send-file.py -d /Home/music/The\ Doors-15.\ When\ The\ Music\'s\ Over.mp3 -t music

```
